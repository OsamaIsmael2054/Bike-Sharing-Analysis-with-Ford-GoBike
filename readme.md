## Summary of Findings

> i noticed that Subscribers rent more than regular Customer may be because Subscribers gets more offers or sales,
people like to rent in (september , october , november) as they are End of year vacation so they dont need to reach there destination faster,
its look like users are more likely to rent if the duration takes less than 20 min,
and finally users likes to rent in hot weather more the cold weather.
